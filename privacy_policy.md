# VR Bronchoscopy Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 11/5/2025

Welcome to VR Bronchoscopy! This policy explains what information we collect when you use our VR application, how we use it, and your rights.

---

## 1. Data We Collect (And Why)

We keep data collection to a minimum, focusing only on what is necessary for the application to function and improve.

| Data Category | Specific Examples | Why We Collect It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Provided by Meta Platform** | Your Meta User ID, Profile Name (from your Meta/Oculus account). | To allow you to log in and access the application. |
| **VR Usage Data** | Time spent in the app, features used, and application performance (crashes, errors). | To understand how the app is used, fix bugs, and improve the application's stability and features. |
| **VR Tracking Data (Important for VR Apps)** | Head and hand movement/position within the application environment. | **Crucially, this data is used *only* for the core functionality of the VR Bronchoscopy simulation (e.g., positioning your virtual view and tools). We DO NOT use this data to identify you or create a biometric profile outside of the simulation.** |

## 2. We Do Not Collect:

* **Personal Health Information (PHI):** Since this is a simulation, we do not collect any real-world patient or health data.
* **Audio/Microphone Recordings:** We do not record or store your voice.
* **Your Real Name or Email:** Unless you contact us directly for support.

## 3. How We Share Your Data

We do not sell any of your data. We share data only in the following limited circumstances:

* **Meta Platforms:** We share data like your Meta User ID and app usage information with Meta Platforms, Inc. (the operator of the Meta Store) as required by their policies for platform functionality and safety. Meta has its own separate privacy policy that governs its use of this data.
* **Service Providers:** We may use third-party services (e.g., a service to track application crashes) that may access Usage Data, but only as necessary to perform their services for us. They are legally bound to protect your data.
* **Legal Requirements:** If we are required to do so by law (e.g., a court order or subpoena).

## 4. How We Protect Your Data

We take reasonable steps to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or electronic storage system is 100% secure.

---

## 5. Your Privacy Rights and Data Deletion

Since we only collect limited data tied to your Meta ID, you have control over this information.

* **Access and Deletion:** To request the deletion of the usage data we hold, or to ask questions about the data linked to your account, please contact us at the support email provided below. We will delete your data within a reasonable timeframe, unless we are required to keep it for legal reasons.
* **Meta Account Controls:** If you wish to manage or delete the data collected by Meta Platforms itself, you must use your controls and settings within your Meta account, as governed by Meta’s own policies.

VR Bronchoscopy is intended for medical and educational users and is **not directed at children under the age of 13.** We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe we have, please contact us so we can delete that information.
